                <h4> SPORTSMANSHIP</h4>
                 <p>The common interest that members of the Association share is to inspire
            youth to practice the ideals of sportsmanship and fair play. Any player, coach,
            team, parent, spectator, administrator or referee whose behavior detracts from
            this purpose is subject to disciplinary action regardless of technical hockey
            background, expertise, accomplishments or standing.

            <ol type="a">
                <li>U-6 play on a field approximately 20 X 40 yards with no penalty areas. Fields

                fifty percent of each game. Coaches in the competition program are encouraged
                to play their players 50% of each game.

                <li>A Coach shall be permitted to not play a player 50% of each game
                    under special circumstances, e.g., unexcused absences from practice
                    and/or games, ungentlemanly conduct at practice and/or games, and
                    injuries.</li>
